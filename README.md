## 🌐 Overview

**Sentinel BlueShield** is an advanced network security automation platform designed to protect, harden, and preserve critical infrastructure environments.

Developed by **Yananth Fajardo Moya**, this solution bridges the gap between:

- ⚡ Physical Infrastructure *(Fiber Optics & Networking)*  
- 🔐 Logical Security *(Cybersecurity & Defense)*  

It eliminates human error in network configuration while enforcing **secure, consistent, and auditable deployments**.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Modern networks demand precision, speed, and resilience.

**Sentinel BlueShield** ensures:

- 🔒 Automated security hardening  
- 💾 Pre-change configuration backups  
- 🧠 Secure baseline enforcement  

> Before any change → **Protect**  
> After execution → **Fortify**

---

## ⚔️ Core Capabilities

### 🧠 Mass Device Orchestration
- Manage multiple routers/switches simultaneously  
- Scalable automation for enterprise environments  

### 💾 Automated Backup System
- Full *running-config* backup before modifications  
- Timestamped records for audit and rollback  

### 🔐 Layer 2/3 Security Hardening
- ❌ Disable insecure protocols *(Telnet, HTTP)*  
- 🔑 Encrypt plaintext passwords  
- ⚠️ Configure MOTD legal banners  
- ⏱️ Enforce session timeouts *(exec-timeout)*  

### 🌐 Secure Communication
- SSH-only connectivity  
- Encrypted and trusted management channel
